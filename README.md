NAME
       Monit - utility for monitoring services on a Unix system

SYNOPSIS
       monit [options] <arguments>

DESCRIPTION
       Monit is a utility for managing and monitoring processes, programs, files, directories and filesystems on a Unix system. Monit conducts automatic maintenance and repair and can execute meaningful causal actions in error
       situations. E.g. Monit can start a process if it does not run, restart a process if it does not respond and stop a process if it uses too much resources. You can use Monit to monitor files, directories and filesystems
       for changes, such as timestamps changes, checksum changes or size changes.

       Monit is controlled via an easy to configure control file based on a free-format, token-oriented syntax. Monit logs to syslog or to its own log file and notifies you about error conditions via customisable alert
       messages. Monit can perform various TCP/IP network checks, protocol checks and can utilise SSL for such checks. Monit provides a HTTP(S) interface and you may use a browser to access the Monit program.
